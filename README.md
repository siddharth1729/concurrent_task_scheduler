# Concurrent Task Scheduler

## Overview

The Concurrent Task Scheduler is a Java-based system designed to efficiently manage the execution of a multitude of independent tasks across multiple processing units. The primary objectives include optimizing resource allocation, handling task dependencies, and ensuring concurrent execution without the risk of data races or deadlocks.

## Features

1. **Multi-threading and Concurrency:** The scheduler leverages Java's robust support for multi-threading and concurrency to execute tasks concurrently, maximizing system performance.

2. **Platform Independence:** Built with the aim of being platform-independent, this system can seamlessly operate on various operating systems and hardware configurations, providing flexibility and adaptability.

3. **Resource Optimization:** Efficient allocation of resources is a key focus, ensuring that each processing unit is utilized optimally to achieve the best possible system throughput.

4. **Task Dependency Management:** The scheduler intelligently manages task dependencies, ensuring that tasks are executed in the correct order to meet application requirements.

5. **Data Race and Deadlock Prevention:** Special attention is given to preventing data races and deadlocks, providing a stable and reliable execution environment for concurrent tasks.

## Usage

To integrate the Concurrent Task Scheduler into your project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/siddharth1729/concurrent_task_scheduler.git
    ```

2. Import the `ConcurrentTaskScheduler` class into your project.

3. Instantiate the scheduler and configure it based on your specific requirements.

4. Submit tasks to the scheduler for concurrent execution.

## Performance Metrics

The system includes performance measurement capabilities to assess its effectiveness. Key metrics, such as task turnaround time and system throughput, are automatically measured and can be accessed for analysis.

## Getting Started

For a quick start, refer to the example provided in the `examples` directory. It demonstrates the basic usage of the Concurrent Task Scheduler and can serve as a foundation for your integration.

## Dependencies

The Concurrent Task Scheduler has minimal dependencies, primarily relying on Java's built-in concurrency features. No additional libraries are required for basic functionality.
